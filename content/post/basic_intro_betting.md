*In my content, I may frequently reference sports betting terminology / ideas. Under the [dry not wet](https://www.codementor.io/joshuaaroke/dry-code-vs-wet-code-89xjwv11w) principle, I am writing this guide.*

A **betting line** offered by sportsbooks is almost always presented as:

<p style='text-align: center;'> <b>[Team] [Spread] [Odds] </b></p>

* The **team** is the team you're betting on in a given match.
* The **spread** is a 'handicap' - (see the example below).
* The **odds** tell you how much money you'll receive, if you win the bet. We'll ignore odds for now. 

You win the bet if:$$\text{[Your Team's Points]} + \text{[Spread]} > \text{[Opposing Team's Points]}$$

### Example

Suppose the Patriots are playing the Dolphins. A sportsbook will often post two lines:

<p style='text-align: center;'>
<b>Patriots -3 -110<br>
Dolphins +3 -110</b>
</p>

Suppose the final score is Patriots 24, Dolphins 17. If you bet Patriots, you win, because if you subtract 3 from the Patriots's point total, it's still greater than the Dolphin's score. 

On the other hand, betting the Dolphins would win if the final score was Patriots 20, Dolphins 19 - even though the Dolphins still lost the actual match. See why?

### Spread

Why not just bet on who wins? Why add a handicap?

Sportsbooks actually do offer lines on who wins games. But in sports, it is infrequent that two teams in a game are 'equal'. So sportsbooks have to offer unintuitive odds such as:

<p style='text-align: center;'>
<b>Patriots -150<br>
Dolphins +130</b>
</p>

The spread serves as a 'handicap' so both sides are roughly *equally likely to happen.* Bettors like this, because they don't have to worry about confusing odds and can just pick whichever side they think is 'more likely to happen.'

### Odds

There are three odds formats:

1. **American Odds:** The most common type of odds format in American sports betting. 

	If the odds are negative, then the odds refer to how much you have to wager to win \$100.  
	If the odds are positive, then the odds refer to how much money you will win if you wager \$100.

	*Example:* 

	* -110 means if you bet \$110 and win, you will receive \$100 (and your \$110 back). 
	* +120 means if you bet \$100 and win, you win \$120 (plus your \$100 back). 

2. **Fractional Odds:** Represent the ratio of [amount you win] to [amount you wager]. 

	*Example:* 

	* 6 to 1 odds means if you win, for every \$1 you bet, you win \$6 (plus your \$1 back). 

3. **Decimal Odds:** Represent the ratio of [amount you win + your wager] to [your wager]

	*Example:* 
	* 1.7 odds means if you win, for every \$1 you bet, you get \$1.70 back total (earning a profit of \$0.70).

### Highly Useful Terminology

* **Spread** - The handicap for a given sports game. It is assumed, unless noted otherwise, that the spread refers specifically to the handicap such that both sides are consiered equally likely. 

	Example: Joe asked Bob, "What's the spread for the Lakers-Clippers game?" Bob says, "It's Lakers -10."  

* **Against the Spread** - Refers to sides of the spread bet, as opposed to sides of the game (who wins).
	
	Example: Joe asks Bob, "Who do you have in tonight's Lakers-Clippers game?" Bob says, "I'll take the Lakers, but I like the Clippers against the spread." 

	Here, Bob thinks the Lakers will win, but not by more than 10 points.

* **Cover** - The winning side of a spread bet is said to 'cover.'

	Example: Joe says, "Who won tonight?" Bob says, "The Lakers won, but failed to cover."

* **Push** - When neither side of a bet covers. 

	Example: Spread is Lakers -10, and Lakers win 100-90. If you subtract 10 from the Laker's score, it equals the Clipper's score. In this case, we say there is a 'push'. Generally, both sides get their money back and the bet is canceled.

### Test Yourself

1. The spread for a game is:

	<p style='text-align: center;'>
	<b>Cowboys -5 -110<br>
	Eagles +5 -110</b>
	</p>

	The final score is Cowboys 20, Eagles 16. Who won? Who covered?

2. Convert **2 to 1** Fractional Odds to Decimal Odds.

3. Convert **+200** American Odds to Decimal Odds.

4. Convert **-200** American Odds to Decimal Odds.

5. You think the Browns have a 5% chance of winning the Super Bowl. The betting odds for the Browns winning the Super Bowl is 15 to 1 (fractional odds). Should you take the bet?
