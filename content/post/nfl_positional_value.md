**TLDR: Teams are devoting more spending resources to 'passing players' - players who feature in the passing game (quarterback, wide receiver), and players who defend the passing game (defensive backs).**

We've all heard the story that the NFL is becoming a passing league. And most would agree that running backs in particular, have seen their value go down in recent years.

One way to measure positional value is to measure how much of its cap space a team is willing to devote to each position - aka how much 'cap market share' a position takes. In this post, I share cap spending breakdowns by position over the years.

### Data

[Spotrac](https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/st.-louis-rams/cap/2011/) provides cap space information from 2011 to current. USA Today used to maintain an online database of cap information going back to 2000, but has since taken access to the database down. I used Way Back Machine to find [archived pages from the site](http://web.archive.org/web/20120427003444/http://content.usatoday.com:80/sportsdata/football/nfl/Patriots/salaries/2003); the earliest year I could find data for all teams was 2003. 

My Jupyter Notebook containing the code for scraping and processing the data can be found [here](github.com).

### Comparing 2003 and 2017

Below are the cap market share breakdowns by position from 2003 and 2017:

![2017 NFL Cap Spending By Position](/img/nfl_positional_value/pie_2017_amended.png#49)

The percentage split, for the most part, is similar between the two years. However, note that with so many positions, and relative limited flexibility in how many players can be rostered at each position (i.e. you're always going to need 2+ quarterbacks, 3+ running backs, 7+ offensive linemen, etc.), even what seem to be 'small' changes in spending can in fact be fairly large changes in positional value.

Take for instance: in a league with just 5 positions (i.e NBA), suppose teams spent 24% of their market cap on point guards. Now suppose teams increased spending on point guards by 25% - now 32% of the cap is devoted to point guards, a noticeable difference. However, the NFL has significantly more positions; if teams spend 5% of their market cap on running backs, and increased spending by 25%, the running back market share would 'only' increase to 6.25% - which doesn't seem as big, even though the shift in positional value might be similar in both cases.

Therefore - my point is: **"small" changes in positional market share should not necessarily be interpreted as trivial changes in positional value** - instead it might be more meaningful to look at percentage change in market share for each position (i.e increasing market share from 5% to 6.25% represents a 25% increase in market share for running backs).

Two of the biggest changes between 2003 and 2017 are at quarterback and running back, corroborating the idea that more than ever before, today's NFL is a passing league.

To get a sense of this change, if teams valued running backs in 2018 as they did in 2003, 49ers Running Back Jerick McKinnon's 4 year, 30 million dollar contract signed in June 2018 turns into a whopping 4 year, 46.5 million dollar contract (assuming teams roster the same number of running backs between years). 

* **Positions Increasing in Cap Share**: Quarterback, Linebacker, Cornerback, Wide Receiver, Tight End, Safety, Punter / Kicker
* **Positions Decreasing in Cap Share**: Running Back, Offensive Linemen, Defensive Tackle, Defensive End

The main surprise to me is that defensive ends have lost value. One potential explanation is the rise of 3-4 defenses; teams are rostering more linebackers and less defensive lineman, and so the spending follows. 

However, this is not a perfect comparison. First, rookie spending was significantly reduced starting with the 2011 NFL draft - so rookie contracts take up a relatively smaller amount of cap market share now. So, for instance, suppose there is no difference in positional valuation between 2003 and 2017. However, if teams tend to draft a lot of offensive linemen in general, you might see offensive linemen taking up a smaller percentage of cap market share in 2017 than in 2003.

Second, the USA Today data shows the cap hits only of the rostered players (52), while Spotrac includes things like Dead Cap - ideally, we would prefer an apples-to-apples comparison. 

### Comparing 2011 and 2017

The earliest contract data is available on Spotrac is 2011; therefore if we want to make an apples-to-apples comparison with 2017, the best we can do is to compare it to 2011.

Spotrac's position labels are also much more descriptive, giving us more meaningful positions to work with:

![2003 NFL Cap Spending By Position](/img/nfl_positional_value/pie_2011.png#49)
![2017 NFL Cap Spending By Position](/img/nfl_positional_value/pie_2017.png#49)

Quarterback and running back are again two positions of note, and we can see many of the same trends as before:

* **Positions Increasing in Cap Share**: Quarterback, Punter, Outside Linebacker, Inside Linebacker, Free Safety, Cornerback, Wide Receiver, Tight End, Strong Safety, Right tackles
* **Positions Decreasing in Cap Share**: Running Back, Left Tackle, Long Snapper, Linebacker, Kicker, Guard, Fullback, Defensive Tackle, Center, Tackle, Safety
* **Positions Staying the Same in Cap Share**: Defensive End

We also see things like spending drastically increasing on right tackles, free safeties, and outside linebackers - though this is accompanied by drastic decreases in spending on the 'Tackle', 'Safety', and 'Linebacker' positions, so it is unclear if spending on these positions are actually on the rise or Spotrac is just getting more precise with its labeling. Note, however, spending is down by a sizable amount on linebackers as a whole (combining ILB, LB, and OLB), decreasing from 14.1% to 12.8%.

I personally was surprised to see spending on guards and centers is dropping - for whatever reason, I have been under the impression that interior offensive linemen have been becoming more valuable - perhaps due to the drafting of interior offensive linemen like Brandon Scherff, Jonathan Cooper, Chance Warmack, and Quentin Nelson in the top 10. It's also curious to me that linebacker spending is dropping (when players like Von Miller are classified as OLB on Spotrac); perhaps this is due to the league transitioning to a 'nickel league' where teams play in nickel defense more often than base defense, thus resulting in less linebackers on the roster.

### Summary

The main takeaway here is that spending on positions that are heavily involved in the passing game is increasing - quarterbacks, wide receivers, tight ends, defensive backs. Meanwhile, as predicted, running back value has shot down by a large margin.

That's no surprise - but it is always nice to see data backing up our hunches.
