Hi! I'm Steven - thanks for visiting my site :).

I use this site primarily to share projects I do related to sports analytics. I've been involved with sports analytics since college, where I was a member of the [Brown Sports Analytics Club](https://brownsportsanalytics.com). 

Outside of sports, interests and hobbies of mine include design, optimizing / quantifying / modeling everyday decisions, learning about how things work, and recently, hiking and learning new languages (to improve cultural immersion and exchange, when I travel).

I graduated from Brown with a degree in Statistics in 2018, and will be working as a trader in New York City starting in September. 

Thanks for stopping by! I welcome feedback on any of my work. If you would like to share feedback, are interested in collaborating, or just want to say hi (really!), please feel free to reach me at liaosteven51@gmail.com!
