#### Font
My preferred font (and my favorite font in general) for viewing this site: [*Brown* by Aurele Sacks](http://www.aurelesack.com/works/ll-brown/).

But, you probably wouldn't need me to tell you that, if you're seeing it ;). 

If you don't have *Brown* installed on your machine (and you probably don't if you're not sure) you're probably viewing this site through [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) or [Bree Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bree+Serif).

#### Artwork
Thanks to the talented [Jennifer Zhu](http://aridax.tumblr.com/) for commissioning my self-portraits!

#### Website
This site is hosted for free on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and built with the [Hugo Static Site Generator](https://gohugo.io/), using the free [Crisp Theme by Thibault Normand](https://themes.gohugo.io/crisp/).
