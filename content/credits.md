#### Font
My preferred font (and my favorite font in general) for viewing this site: [brown by aurele sacks](http://www.aurelesack.com/works/ll-brown/)

But, you probably wouldn't need me to tell you that, if you're seeing it ;). 

If you don't have *brown* installed on your machine (and you probably don't if you're not sure) you're probably viewing this site through [open sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) or [bree serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bree+Serif)

#### Artwork
Thanks to the talented [jennifer zhu](http://aridax.tumblr.com/) for commissioning my self-portraits

#### Website
This site is hosted for free on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), and built using the [hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/), using the free [crisp theme by thibault normand](https://themes.gohugo.io/crisp/)'
